        <p class="lead">I am currently a freshmen at CSULB and in the Computer Science Program. Eventually, I hope to become a software engineering after I graduate. Outside of school, I spend a handful of my time on my computer or cooking. I understand that in order to be successful in your major, you have to be passionate about it outside of school and boy do I love money. When I'm not in school, I enjoy going to the gym, hanging out with my friends, and playing video games. One of my favorite video games is currently Valorant where I have a love hate relationship with. One day, I hope that I can either make enough from reselling on Amazon or landing a job as a software engineering that I can support my family. Since I love to cook, I also really love to eat and one of my go-to meals is definitely a nice bowl of pho or Korean barbecue. I think besides Computer Science, food is definitely one of my biggest passions because you are able to introduce a culture to some through food without them understanding the language.   

I also enjoy traveling and I hope to travel after covid gets better, Pfizer is about to come in handy for the summer season</p>
